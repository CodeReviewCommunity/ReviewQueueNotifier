# Review Queue Notifier

##This is a Script for the Stack Exchange Network

This Script will make it so that you are notified on the Desktop whenever new reviews are available, as long as you have a review tab open.

###How to use
- Install [Greasemonkey](http://www.greasespot.net/) (Firefox) or [Tampermonkey](http://tampermonkey.net/) (Chrome). These are userscript managers and allow the script to make use of `GM_*` functions
- Install the script: <kbd>[install](https://github.com/malachi26/ReviewQueueNotifier/blame/master/ReviewQueueNotification.user.js)</kbd> or <kbd>[view source](https://github.com/malachi26/ReviewQueueNotifier/blob/master/ReviewQueueNotification.user.js)</kbd>
- Any time you have a review queue window open, the script will run and alert you anytime there are reviews to be performed.

###Notes
